# Covid-19 Vaccination Analysis on SQL


# The covid-19 Pandemic was one of a kind that took many lives. I embarked on a journey to get insights on Covid's impact on the World. The datasets of this project are from WHO.

The following questions are what this analysis seeks to answer:

- Percent Population Vaccinated
- PercentPopulationVaccinated
- Deaths By Continent
- Continents with the highest death count per population
- Countries with Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population
- Total cases & population percentage infected
- Total Cases vs Total Deaths in Nigeria
